## Dataset and Problem Description

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Early detection is crucial for improving patient care and management, but it remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of contributing factors and the long progression period of the disease. This project aims to develop a predictive model to assess the likelihood of an individual having Alzheimer's disease based on a range of features, including demographic details, medical history, lifestyle factors, clinical measurements, and cognitive assessments.

The datasets used in this project include publicly available and restricted datasets:

- [**Kaggle Alzheimer’s Disease Risk Prediction Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/alzheimers-disease-risk-prediction-eu-business/data): This dataset includes health-related features for predicting AD diagnosis, categorized as either 0 (No Alzheimer’s Disease) or 1 (Alzheimer’s Disease).
- [**ADNI (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) Dataset**](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/adni-data/#AccessData): The ADNI dataset is a comprehensive, widely used collection of longitudinal clinical, imaging, genetic, and biomarker data. It includes structural, functional, and molecular brain imaging, biofluid biomarkers, cognitive assessments, genetic data, and demographics. The database [documentation](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/help-faqs/adni-documentation/) can be found here. To build our predictive models, we must extract relevant datasets, merge features from different tests, clean and impute data, and identify the most impactful factors for model accuracy.

## Stakeholders

- **Healthcare professionals:** Neurologists, geriatricians, and general practitioners who will use the model for early detection and diagnosis.
- **Patients and families:** Individuals at risk of AD and their families who would benefit from early intervention and disease management strategies.
- **Medical researchers:** Scientists studying AD progression, risk factors, and potential treatments.
- **Pharmaceutical companies:** Companies involved in developing treatments for AD that could benefit from early diagnosis models.
- **Public health organizations:** Government and non-governmental agencies focused on neurological disease prevention and early detection programs.

## Company Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Model accuracy and performance:** Measured using metrics such as AUC-ROC, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Early detection success rate:** The proportion of correctly identified early-stage AD cases.
- **Data integration efficiency:** The ability to harmonize and utilize multiple datasets effectively.
- **Clinical adoption rate:** The extent to which healthcare professionals use the predictive model.
- **Patient outcomes improvement:** Measured by tracking early interventions and delayed progression rates.
- **Research impact:** Contributions to AD research, publications, and citations related to the model’s findings.
- **User engagement and feedback:** Monitoring feedback from healthcare professionals and researchers on the model's usability and effectiveness.
