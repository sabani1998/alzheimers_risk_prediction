# alzheimers_risk_prediction

## Dataset and Problem Description

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Early detection is crucial for improving patient care and management, but it remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of contributing factors and the long progression period of the disease. This project aims to develop a predictive model to assess the likelihood of an individual having Alzheimer's disease based on a range of features, including demographic details, medical history, lifestyle factors, clinical measurements, and cognitive assessments.

The datasets used in this project include publicly available and restricted datasets:

- [Kaggle Alzheimer’s Disease Risk Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/alzheimers-disease-risk-prediction-eu-business/data): This dataset includes health-related features for predicting AD diagnosis, categorized as either 0 (No Alzheimer’s Disease) or 1 (Alzheimer’s Disease).
- [ADNI (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) Dataset](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/adni-data/#AccessData): The ADNI dataset is a comprehensive, widely used collection of longitudinal clinical, imaging, genetic, and biomarker data. It includes structural, functional, and molecular brain imaging, biofluid biomarkers, cognitive assessments, genetic data, and demographics. The database [documentation](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/help-faqs/adni-documentation/) can be found here. To build our predictive models, we must extract relevant datasets, merge features from different tests, clean and impute data, and identify the most impactful factors for model accuracy.
