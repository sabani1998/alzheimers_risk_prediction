# alzheimers_risk_prediction

## Dataset and Problem Description

Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Early detection is crucial for improving patient care and management, but it remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of contributing factors and the long progression period of the disease. This project aims to develop a predictive model to assess the likelihood of an individual having Alzheimer's disease based on a range of features, including demographic details, medical history, lifestyle factors, clinical measurements, and cognitive assessments.

The datasets used in this project include publicly available and restricted datasets:
